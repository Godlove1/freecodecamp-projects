<p> Barthélemy Biya'a bi Mvondo; 13 February 1933) is a Cameroonian politician serving as the president of Cameroon since 6
November 1982. He is the second-longest-ruling president in Africa, the longest-ruling non-royal leader in the
world, and the oldest head-of-state in Africa.</p>
<p>
A native of Cameroon's south, Biya rose rapidly as a bureaucrat under President Ahmadou Ahidjo in the 1960s, serving as
Secretary-General of the Presidency from 1968 to 1975 and then as Prime Minister of Cameroon from 1975 to 1982. He
succeeded Ahidjo as president upon the latter's surprise resignation in 1982 and consolidated power in a 1983–1984
staged attempted coup in which he eliminated all his rivals.</p>
<p>
His regime is supported by France, which supplies it with weapons and trains its forces. France is the leading foreign
investor, ahead of the United States. One hundred and five French subsidiaries are located in all key sectors (oil,
timber, construction, mobile telephony, transport, banking, insurance, etc.).</p>
<p>
Biya introduced political reforms within the context of a one-party system in the 1980s. Under serious pressure, he
accepted the introduction of multiparty politics in the early 1990s. He won the contentious 1992 presidential election
with 40% of the plural, single-ballot vote and was re-elected by large margins in 1997, 2004, 2011 and 2018. Opposition
politicians and Western governments have alleged voting irregularities and fraud on each of these occasions. Many
independent sources have provided evidence that he did not win the elections in 1992, and that subsequent elections were.</p>
<p>
Biya has maintained Cameroon's close relationship with France, one of Cameroon's former colonial rulers.
