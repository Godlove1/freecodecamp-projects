			<p>By default, the only JavaScript code that’s loaded is a small shim that watches for <code>onmouseover</code> and onfocus for the
			search input field. <li>there’s </li>also an event listener on the whole document that looks for a certain keystroke Pressing
			/ at any point, acts the same as if you had used your mouse cursor to put focus into the input field.</p> As soon as focus
			is triggered, the first thing it does is download two JavaScript <code>bundles</code> which turns the input field into something
			much more advanced.In its simplest (pseudo) form, here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We create the FlexSearch index just once and re-use it for every new keystroke. Because the user might type more while
waiting for the network,<li>it’s actually reactive so executes the actual search once all the JavaScript and the</li> <code>JSON XHR</code>
have arrived.</p>
<p>
Before we dig into what this FlexSearch is, let’s talk about how the display actually works.</p>
 <p>For that we use a React
library called downshift which handles all the interactions, displays, and makes sure the displayed search results are
accessible.</p> <p>downshift is a mature library that handles a myriad of challenges with building a widget like that,
especially the aspects of making it accessible.</p>
<p>
So, what is this <code>FlexSearch</code>
library? <li>It’s another third party that makes sure that searching on titles is done with</li>
natural language in mind. It describes itself as the “Web’s fastest and most memory-flexible full-text search library
with zero dependencies.”</p><p> which is a lot more performant and accurate than attempting to simply look for one string in a
long list of other strings.</p>

<p>n fairness, if the user types foreac, it’s not that hard to reduce a list of 10,000+ document titles down to only those
that contain foreac in the title, then we decide which result to show first. The way we implement that is relying on
pageview stats.</p>
<p> We record, for every single MDN URL, which one gets the most pageviews as a form of determining
“popularity”. The documents that most people decide to arrive on are most probably what the user was searching for.
</p><p>
Our build-process that generates the <code>search-index.json</code> file knows about each URLs number of pageviews. We actually don’t
care about absolute numbers, but what we do care about is the relative differences. For example,</p>
<p> we know that
Array.prototype.forEach() (that’s one of the document titles) is a more popular page than
TypedArray.prototype.forEach(), so we leverage that and sort the entries in search-index.json accordingly.</p>
<p> Now, with
FlexSearch doing the reduction, we use the “natural order” of the array as the trick that tries to give users the
document they were probably looking for. </p><p>It’s actually the same technique we use for Elasticsearch in our full
site-search.

<p>ctually, it’s not a whimsical easter egg, but a feature that came from the fact that this autocomplete needs to work for
our content creators. You see, when you work on the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content">content in MDN</a> you start a local “preview server” which is a
complete copy of all documents but all running locally, as a static site, under http://localhost:5000. There, you don’t
want to rely on a server to do searches. Content authors need to quickly move between documents, so much of the reason
why the autocomplete search is done entirely in the client is because of that.

Commonly implemented in tools like the <code>VSCode</code> and Atom IDEs, you can do “fuzzy searches” to find and open files simply
by typing portions of the file path. For example, searching for whmlemvo should find the file
files/web/html/element/video. 
<li>You can do that with MDN’s autocomplete search too. The way you do it is by typing / as
the first input character</li>.</p>

<p>The code for all of this is in the Yari repo which is the project that builds and previews all of the MDN content. To
find the exact code, click into the client/src/search.tsx source code and you’ll find all the code for lazy-loading,
searching, preloading, and displaying autocomplete searches.</p>
